Description: LiMux Shutdown Scheduling for Logind
 Handle users' shutdown requests and system events requiring shutdown.
 .  
 There are two interfaces: one for processing user shutdown requests and 
 one for system events to schedule a shutdown e.g. for system updates. 
 .
 A DBus interface to logind is used to get information about user sessions
 and conduct actual shutdown.
